### When the network is way too slow.
STEP 1: Go to annaconda.org/conda-forge and search the module to be installed in the check box 
STEP 2: Download the right module, i.e. the module mathes our platform (e.g., linux 64) and the python version (e.g., python 3.7) 
STEP 3: After having downloaded it, we install it: conda install your_package 

Note: (1) If there doesnot exist a module which match our platform or python version, we may go to pypi.org and down load the source files 
And then unzip it, run command: python setup.py install   
     (2) We may run command in the terminal under specific conda environment.
